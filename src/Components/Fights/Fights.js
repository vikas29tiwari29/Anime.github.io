                        <p className={style.p}>Naruto and Sasuke's final showdown arrived after almost 700 episodes of both the original Naruto series and its sequel Shippuden. The story had ample time to fully explore its world, its power system of chakra, and the limitations of the shinobi who wielded its greatest powers. If everything that happened beforehand could be likened to classroom lectures, Naruto vs Sasuke was the final exam. Just two shinobi couldn't display every single jutsu mentioned in the show, but their fight delivered a comprehensive study of everything both had amassed at the time. This included some quite overt references, such as Naruto's Rasengans and more subtle ones like Sasuke's one-handed seals. </p>

                        <p className={style.p}>When compared to Kaido, Luffy is, in no way, an equal to him yet. However, Luffy aims to take down Kaido at Wano Country, and when he says something, he certainly does it. Luffy has already lost to Kaido twice, but these losses occurred when Luffy did not know how to use an advanced form of Conqueror's Haki.</p>
